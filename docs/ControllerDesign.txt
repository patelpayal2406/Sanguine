The controller will use methods from the model to interact with the board and ensure that correct moves are being made.

The controller will have high-level try/catch clauses to reject invalid moves and ensure that the game functions as intended.

We're making the assumption that the players see and interact with their own deck of cards independently.

Some methods we will implement include:
- `Card selectCard(Player player, int index)` - Selects a card from the specified player's deck
- `playCard(Card card)` - Plays a card using the model method, accounting for potential exceptions from invalid moves
- `skipTurn()` - Skips the current player's turn using the model's `pass` method
- Other methods from the model for getting the state (current player, etc.)

The controller will also contain deck hand management for each player. This will pair with valid move checks and current player move tracking.
